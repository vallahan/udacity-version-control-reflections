What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize the respository, a .git folder is created. It doesn't do anything until you choose to make a commit.
It then allows the user to add files to the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are collected for preparation of being moved into the commit.
It offers the benefits of giving the user a place to organize files and establish their files for each commit.
Each commit is different, but some are likely to include (or not include) files different to another commit.
